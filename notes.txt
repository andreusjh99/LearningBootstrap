Breakpoints
================
Customisable widths that determine how your responsive layout behaves across different viewport sizes

Bootstrap has 6 different breakpoints, also known as grid tiers.
- extra small
- small (sm)
- medium (md)
- large (lg)
- extra large (xl)
- extra extra large (xxl)

Each breakpoint was chosen to comfortably hold containers whose widths are multiples of 12.

Containers
=================
Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap.
Required when using default Bootstrap grid system.

Bootstrap comes with 3 different containers:
- .container
    responsive and has different max-widths according to the different breakpoints.
    You will see margins on the left and right of the container.
- .container-{breakpoint}
    eg. .container-lg (large)
    The `width: 100%` for sizes lower the breakpoint, and will follow the max-width for each breakpoint beyond the breakpoint size.
    i.e. .container-lg will have 100% width (no side margins) until the lg breakpoint, then will have width following the max-width of each responsive breakpoint when the size of the viewport increases.
- .container-fluid
    Width will always be 100%.

Note that a container is specified using the html class attribute.
    -> <div class="container-md"> </div>

So the type of containers decides the width of the container, and the width is split into 12 units.

Border class
--------------
Creates a border around the element.
